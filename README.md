# Species-Audio-Identification-Tool-


explain the problem - something like:

_the field station I worked with had months, if not years of audio data, but did not have the hundreds of volunteers it would need to go through each recording and identify the species heard within. The issue with identification skill. Don't know what's on the island so difficult to apply for funding and build a case for protection against rapidly enroaching aqua/agriculture_

explain the tool, something like: 

_(DL, anonymised for GH) "Intended to be run with as little interaction as possible - hence the folder and file checks to avoid errors - due to the need for this to be operable by volunteers"), weaknesses (distance = lower chance to detect, doesn't account for imperfect detection)_

define how we're calculating population size:

_grab those papers for the actual definition_

Define species richness & biodiversity, and describe trend/caveats

### PLACEHOLDER IMAGE - RICHNESS BY LOCATION AND MONTH

Describe relationships - something like - those in smaller groups tend to heard to make fewer calls both per individual and in total

## placeholder title

explain 'under the hood' for a non technical audience. explain the graph is to identify which species need more files for DL model training
