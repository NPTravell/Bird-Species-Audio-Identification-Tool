# Bird-Species-Audio-Identification-Tool


### what is the problem PLACEHOLDER SUBTITLE

Whilst working with an ecological field station, the issue of having years of (good!) audio data but no capacity to analyse it. It would take hundreds of volunteers to listen to these recordings and identify which species were present by any meaningful deadline. Furthermore, any volunteer would have to invest time training to identify calls (of which there may be a dizzying number), after which there is no guarantee of accuracy due to a range of factors - such as background noise from weather dramatically affecting what can be accurately heard.

Without knowing what species are on the island it would be difficult to apply for funding to continue conservation efforts, and almost impossible to build a case for protecting the land against rapidly enroaching aquaculture and tourism expansion.

### why record audio? PLACEHOLDER SUBTITLE

explain the tool, something like: 

_(DL, anonymised for GH) "Intended to be run with as little interaction as possible - hence the folder and file checks to avoid errors - due to the need for this to be operable by volunteers"), weaknesses (distance = lower chance to detect, doesn't account for imperfect detection)_

define how we're calculating population size:

_grab those papers for the actual definition_

Define species richness & biodiversity, and describe trend/caveats

Describe relationships - something like - those in smaller groups tend to heard to make fewer calls both per individual and in total

explain 'under the hood' for a non technical audience. explain the graph is to identify which species need more files for DL model training
recall - What proportion of actual positives was identified correctly? (more important - we want to know if the species was there)
precision - What proportion of positive identifications was actually correct? (not AS bad if we say that a species was there when it wasn't)
Accuracy is generally linked inversely to loss, so we want as little as possible
